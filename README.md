# Orchestrator Workflow

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the **Orchestrator-Worker** workflow using LangGraph.

The workflow demonstrates orchestrating multiple AI agents to write sections of a report. The orchestrator assigns tasks to workers, who execute them in parallel, and a synthesizer node combines the outputs into a final report.

## Contents
- `orchestrator_workflow.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file with LangGraph workflow.

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the workflow and see parallelized report generation.
